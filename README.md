## Overview

The Form Builder Application allows users to create, submit, and analyze forms. Built using Django REST Framework for the backend and Next.js for the frontend, this application provides a platform for Admins to create forms, manage responses, and view analytics, while End Users can anonymously submit responses.


### Features:

#### Admin Features:
- **Create Forms**: Admins can create unlimited forms with up to 100 questions per form.
- **Question Configuration**: Admins can configure different types of questions (e.g., text, dropdown, checkbox) and order them within a form.
- **View Forms**: Admins can view a list of forms they have created and manage them.
- **Analytics**: Admins can access detailed analytics for each form, including response counts and question-specific insights.

#### End User Features:
- **Submit Responses**: End users can respond to forms anonymously, with no need for authentication.
- **Unlimited Submissions**: Users can submit responses as many times as they like.

#### Shared Features:
- **View Analytics**: Both Admins and End Users can access form analytics through a public URL, including:
  - Total response count at the form level.
  - Question-specific analytics for Text, Checkbox, and Dropdown questions.




## Conclusion:
This project provides an intuitive platform for form creation, submission, and analytics. The modular design allows for easy expansion and supports future features such as additional question types.
